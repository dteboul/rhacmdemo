If you plan to create a GitHub channel type, you must manually patch the 
CRD for the Channel CR (channels.app.ibm.com) to include the new GitHub 
channel type. After you add the channel type, you can create GitHub 
channels. To add this type, run the following command:

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-cluster-management/multicloud-operators-channel/master/deploy/crds/apps.open-cluster-management.io_channels_crd.yaml
